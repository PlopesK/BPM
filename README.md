# BPM
A site made for those who love music <br><br>

BPM is a site thinked by André Gabriel, Gabriel Monfardini, Luíz Gustavo, Leandro Camargo and César Paneto <br>
Since they were having some problem programming the site, they asked my help, so I decided to assist them. <br><br>

I decided to create this repository to make it easier to orgnize all ideas, and well, they don't have an git hub account (and don't know how to use it neither). <br><br>

<strong> All credit ideas goes to them, I'm just helping them since they don't have a lot of time </strong> <br><br>

Since the site uses a lot of PHP (and github doesn't support it), I will change some files from PHP to HTML only in this repository to show them my changes in execution.
