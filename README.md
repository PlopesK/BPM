# BPM ðŸŽ¶
<h2>Summary</h2>
<h3>ðŸŽµ A site made for those who love music ðŸŽµ</h3>

BPM is a site thinked by AndrÃ© Gabriel, Gabriel Monfardini, LuÃ­z Gustavo, Leandro Camargo and CÃ©sar Paneto <br>
Since they were having some problem programming the site, they asked my help! :D <br>

I decided to create this repository to make it easier to organize all ideas. They don't have an git hub account (and don't know how to use it either). <br>

Since the site uses a lot of PHP (and github doesn't support it), I will change some files from PHP to HTML only in this repository to show them my changes in execution. <br>

<b> All credit ideas goes to them, I'm just helping them since they don't have a lot of time </b> <br>
<b>ðŸŽ§ All design ideas where coded by me, they just said how it should look. (And approved  my changes) ðŸŽ§</b>
